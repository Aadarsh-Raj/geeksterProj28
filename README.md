As we have given the project with codes of html4, and I have successfully made it using html5.<br>
The projects have been divide in further sections to manage the every pixel.
The images have been fixed their positions by using flex property and some boxes have been positioned by using position property. <br>
Here the images with red and green color have been sectioned to one part and have given some margin and padding to manage paragraphs according to given UI.<br>
There are many images which container text over them and the position relative has been used to manage/overlap the containers over the images. <br>
